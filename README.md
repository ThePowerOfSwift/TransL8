# TransL8

Simple iOS client for translating via [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com).

## Idea

I've enjoyed and used the great translation service from [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com) a lot recently but could not find a simple yet deeply integrated mobile app for it. Hence this project was born:

- provide a straight forward mobile client to the [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com) translation service
- use multiple text input methods of recent iOS SDKs (clipboard, OCR via camera, voice via microphone)
- serve translated text via various outputs (clipboard, text sharing, voice)

## Installation

You need Xcode 11 and iOS 13 to build and run this app. Furthermore a paid [DeepL Pro Account with API access](https://www.deepl.com/pro-account.html) is needed for the translation - it's worth it but I earn no money out of that promotion!

## Future

Feel free to fork and extend it's core features. In the future, more feature are planned:

- Action extension
- Share extension
- Widget
- Keyboard extension
- iMessage extension
- Siri intents
- serve clipboard history as a Document provider extension
- x-url-mechanics
- drag&drop support on iPads
- Catalyst support
